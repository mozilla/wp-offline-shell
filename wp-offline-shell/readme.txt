A WordPress plugin for caching theme assets via the [ServiceWorker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers) to improve performance and make them available offline or on slow connections.

== Description ==

Offline Shell is a WordPress plugin which utilizes the client side [ServiceWorker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers "Learn more") to cache theme files for performance and offline purposes.

The WordPress admin can select which files to cache, update the cache list at any time, and see their site performance improve while ensuring important assets are available offline.

== Installation ==

Installation of the plugin is simple:

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-offline-shell` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Offline Shell screen to configure the plugin
4. Check the "Enable Service Worker" checkbox and then select individual files you'd like cached.  These assets should be files you use on most pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin allow for offline reading of content? =

No, but couple this plugin with the [Offline Content](https://wordpress.org/plugins/offline-content/) plugin and you can have functioning pages and assets offline.

= Does this plugin modify my theme files? =

Absolutely not -- no files are modified or generated by this plugin.

= When should the theme file options be updated? =

It's best to update the plugin file options when you've added a new file to your theme that you'd like cached.  Files that change or are deleted will be automatically detected and will not create problems within the service worker.

= Can I provide feedback? =

Of course! Service Workers are an emerging technology so this plugin should be updated often based on feedback from developers using WordPress in different ways

== Screenshots ==

1. File selection screen -- the admin may choose which files to cache
2. The Network tab of DevTools shows that the files have been retrieved from cache instead of network
3. Debug displays in the console so you know what is and isn't being cached
